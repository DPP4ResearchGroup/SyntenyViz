abstract = "Comparative genomics is narrowly defined as a research strategy to infer the functions and loci of genes in a target genome from information obtained by analyzing a certain genome. In this report, basic knowledge and concepts for comparative genome analysis are explained. Some representative reports of comparative genomics relevant to each knowledge and concepts are also introduced. Most of these examples focus on the analysis of animal genomes and related evolutionary research; however, the basic ideas behind these examples also apply to other biological taxa."

To do so, we have developed a new open-source software library called CGL (for “Comparative Genomics Library”). Our results demonstrate that change in intron–exon structure is gradual, clock-like, and largely independent of coding-sequence evolution. This means that genome annotations can be used in new ways to inform, corroborate, and test conclusions drawn from comparative genomics analyses that are based upon protein and nucleotide sequence similarities.},

This chapter focuses on comparative genomics. Comparative genomic resources are helpful to further establish zebrafish as an excellent model organism for studying vertebrate development and genetics and for modeling human biological processes and diseases. Genomic comparison between zebrafish and other vertebrate model organisms provides useful information that one can use to understand the evolution of each vertebrate species. At the same time, this comparison facilitates the use of genomic information obtained in other vertebrate organisms for zebrafish research projects and vice versa. It is therefore important to create and use comparative genomic tools and resources to accelerate research projects in zebrafish and other vertebrates. The chapter also provides resources for comparative genomic studies. To demonstrate how one can use the available comparative genomic studies resources, the chapter also presents an updated version of the bioinformatic method used in the positional cloning of the zebrafish hypochromic mutant weissherbst. A vast amount of genomic information is available to the zebrafish community. To take advantage of these resources, researchers need to be able to use comparative genomic analysis as a tool for identifying potential mutant genes in positional and candidate cloning projects of zebrafish genetic mutants."
